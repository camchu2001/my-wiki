> **Problem**: Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over **as few cards as possible**. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.

**Solution:** Step by step. 
1. <u>State the problem</u>: we need to write a program to find the *position* of a given number in *a list of numbers* sorted in decreasing order in minimum number of steps. 
	* <u>Input</u>: 
		* a list of number sorted in decreasing order
		* a number `num` whose position in the array is to be determined. 
	* <u>Output</u>: the position of the `num` in the list of cards

→ We can come up with the *function initialization* for our program: 
```python
def locate_card(cards, number): 
	pass
```

2. <u>Example inputs and outputs:</u> 
This is **one test case** that we use to test the correctness of the program we write, using example inputs and outputs.
```python
cards = [13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0]
number = 7
output = 3
```
* To test our function, we can compare the **result of the function** with the **expected position:** 
```python
result = locate_card(cards, query)
result == output # check if true to see if our program executed correctly
```
* To test our test cases efficiently, we can store them as dictionaries with two keys, `input` and `output`
```python
test = {
    'input': { 
        'cards': [13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0], 
        'number': 7
    },
    'output': 3
}
```
→ the function can be tested as follows: 
```python
locate_card(**test['input']) == test['output']
```
