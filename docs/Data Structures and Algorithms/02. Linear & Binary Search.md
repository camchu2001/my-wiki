> **Problem**: Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over **as few cards as possible**. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.

**Solution:** Step by step. 
1. <u>State the problem</u>: we need to write a program to find the *position* of a given number in *a list of numbers* sorted in decreasing order in minimum number of steps. 
	* <u>Input</u>: 
		* a list of number sorted in decreasing order
		* a number `num` whose position in the array is to be determined. 
	* <u>Output</u>: the position of the `num` in the list of cards

â†’ We can come up with a function for our program: 
```python
def locate_card(cards, num): 
	pass
```

2. <u>Example inputs and outputs:</u> 
```python
cards = [13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0]
number = 7
position = 3
```
