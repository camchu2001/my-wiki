**Measures the “goodness” of an Algorithm of a Data Structure.** 
## 1. Time and Space Complexity
1. **Time complexity** is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to execute. 
	* Running time of an algorithm is *proportional*, it increases with the size of the input. 
2. **Space complexity** is the amount of memory used by the algorithm while executing. 
## 2. Function Growth
