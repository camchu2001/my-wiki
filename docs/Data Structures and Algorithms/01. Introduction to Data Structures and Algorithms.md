## 1. Definition 
1. **Data Structures** are different ways of storing data in computer memory so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. 
<u>Examples</u>: stacks, queues, array, linked list, etc. 
2. **Algorithms**: operations on different data structures with sets of step-by-step instructions for executing them. 

Each data structure and algorithm has its own advantage and disadvantage, understanding this can help you write efficient software as a developer
## 2. Complexities
1. **Time complexity** is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to execute. 
	* Running time of an algorithm is *proportional*, it increases with the size of the input. 
2. **Space complexity** is the amount of memory used by the algorithm while executing. 
The time required for executing a code depends
