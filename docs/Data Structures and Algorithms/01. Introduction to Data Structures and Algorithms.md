## 1. Definition 
1. **Data Structures**: different ways of storing data in computer memory so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. 
<u>Examples</u>: stacks, queues, array, linked list, etc. 
* The main idea behind using data structures is to **minimize** the time and space complexities. 
* An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

2. **Algorithms**: operations on different data structures with sets of step-by-step instructions for executing them. 
## 2. Complexity
**Complexity** of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size `n`. 
* The term *complexity* almost always refers to the ***worst-case complexity*** → the highest/longest possible time/space taken by the algorithm to process an input. 
*  Hence, we always design our program keeping the worst case in mind. 

1. **Time complexity** is the amount of time required to execute the code.
2. **Space complexity** is the amount of memory required to successfully execute the functionalities of the code. 
### Big-O Notation (O): 
- **Big O notation** is a mathematical way to express the **upper bound** (biggest, highest, worst-case) of an algorithm's time complexity (or sometimes space complexity). 
- Common Big O notations include:
    - **O(1):** Constant time (independent of input size) - ideal scenario
    - **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time (increases slowly with input size)
    - **O(n)**: Linear time (proportional to input size)
    - **O(n log n)**: Log-linear time (balances logarithmic and linear growth)
    - **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time (increases more significantly with input size) - avoid for large datasets if possible
    - **O (exponential)**: Exponential time (extremely rapid growth with input size) - generally undesirable

## 3. Strategy for Solving DSA Problems
1. **State the problem clearly. Identify the input and output formats.** 
2. **Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.** 
3. **Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State your answer out loud to practice demonstrating your answer to an interviewer.** 
4. **Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.** 
5. **Analyze the algorithm’s complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.** 
6. **Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat step 3-6.**
