## 1. Static Arrays
### 1. Introduction
**Arrays** are a way of storing data **contiguously**. 
* In strictly typed languages like Java, C++, C#, etc, arrays have an allocated size when initialized. → **static arrays** → the size of the array cannot change after initialization.
* Loosely typed languages such as Python and JavaScript do not have static arrays, they use **dynamic arrays**.

The most commons operations we can perform on an array are: **reading, deletion, and insertion**. 
### 2. Reading from an Array
Array elements are accessed through **indices**, which start at index `0`. Reading from an array is as simple as accessing the index of the element in that array.
```python
myArray = [1, 3, 4] # array initialization

# access an arbitrary element, where i is the index of the desired value
myArray[i]
```

As long as the index of an element is known, the access is **instant**. This is because each value at an index of the array is mapped to an address in RAM. 
* Regardless of the size of the input, the time taken to access the element at the given index is always unaffected and instant. → **O(1) time complexity**.
#### Traversing through an array
Traversing through an array means that we **iterate through all the values of an array**, usually we do that using a **loop**. 
```python
for i in range(len(myArray)):
   print(myArray[i])

# OR

i = 0
while i < len(myArray):
   print(myArray[i])
   i += 1
```
* Traversal through an array of size `n` is **O(n)** → the number of operations is linear to `n`. 
* In the example above, if the size of `n` is doubled, the number of operations for traversal would also double.
### 3. Deleting from an array
#### 1. Deleting from the end of the array
* In strictly typed languages, all array indices are **filled with `0s`** or some default value upon initialization, denoting an empty array.
* When we want to **remove an element** from the **last index** of an array, setting its value to `0` / `null` or `-1` does the job.
* We will also **reduce the length by `1`** since we have one less element in the array after deletion.
* Because we can have instant access to the last element of the array, deleting the last element of the array is always **O(1)**.
``` python
def removeEnd(arr, length): 
	if length > 0: 
		arr[length - 1] = 0 #setting the last index's value to 0
```

#### 2. Deleting at an `ith` index
When we want to delete an element at a random index `i`,  we won’t be able to perform this in **O(1)**. 
* We can’t just replace the value at that index `i` with a `0`, we have to shift each element from `i + 1` till the end of the array `1` position to the left, otherwise we’d break the **contiguous** order of array. 
* In the worst case scenario, if we want to delete the first element of the array, we’d need to shift **all** of the elements to the left. → **O(n) time complexity**
```python
# Remove value at index i before shifting elements to the left.
# Assuming i is a valid index.
def removeMiddle(arr, i, length):
    # Shift starting from i + 1 to end.
    for index in range(i + 1, length):
        arr[index - 1] = arr[index]
    # No need to 'remove' arr[i], since we already shifted
```

### 4. Insertion
#### 1. Inserting at the end of the array
Since we can **always access the last index** of the array, inserting an element at the end of an array is **O(1)** time.
```python
# Insert n into arr at the next open position.
# Length is the number of 'real' values in arr, and 
# capacity is the size (aka memory allocated for the fixed size array).
def insertEnd(arr, n, length, capacity):
    if length < capacity:
        arr[length] = n
```
#### 2. Inserting at the `ith` index
* If we insert at index `i` as is, we would overwrite the current value. To insert without overwriting existing values, we need to shift all values from `i` one position to the right. 
```python
# Insert n into index i after shifting elements to the right.
# Assuming i is a valid index and arr is not full.
def insertMiddle(arr, i, n, length):
    # Shift starting from the end to i.
    for index in range(length - 1, i - 1, -1):
        arr[index + 1] = arr[index]
    
    # Insert at i
    arr[i] = n
```

## 2. Dynamic Arrays
**Dynamic Arrays** are more common and useful thanks to their ability to resize. Dynamic arrays are the default types of array for Python and JavaScript. 
* For static arrays, we specify the size of the array when we created that array. 
* But for a **dynamic array**, you **don’t necessarily need have to specify the size**. If you don’t specify the size, usually it’ll specify the array to a default size. 
### 1. Operations on Dynamic Arrays 
* When we **push** a value to the dynamic array, we are **adding** a value to the end of the array, to the next available empty index. 
* When we **pop** a value from the dynamic array, we are **removing** a value from the end of the array. 
→ Both of these operations have a time complexity of **O(1)** because we can always access the last value instantly.

Since the array is dynamic, **adding another element** when we run out of capacity is achieved by **copying over** the values of the current array **to a new array** that is the **double** the original size. 
* **Double the size** is a middle ground between not having to allocate a brand new array every time we add a new element, and not wanting to having a bunch of empty space.

→ this operation will run in **amortized O(1)**.
