# Welcome! 
Hello there~ My name is **Cam**, welcome to my wiki page, a giant notebook for everything I am learning and am interested in, all written down using **Obsidian**. 

This page is not a finished product, but more like a living document that grows with me. Feel free to explore my notes and see if anything catches your eye. Iâ€™m still learning, so my notes arenâ€™t perfect yet ðŸ˜…. If you find anything youâ€™d like to give me **feedback** on, you can contact me through my [website](https://camchu.me/) â€“ I'd love to connect! 

Hopefully, youâ€™ll find something interesting here. Thanks for stopping by!

# Build your own Wiki Page
This simple wiki page was built using Docusaurus, itâ€™s a site generator that you can use to quickly build and publish your personal notes. I find their [Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs) really helpful, if you want, you can take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/camchu2001/my-wiki) for a better idea.

# Publish your Obsidian notes
My workflow is really simple. What I do is back up my Obsidian notes to my GitHub repo using Obsidianâ€™s [Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), then deploy my wiki site using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

There are other ways to publish and [deploy](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) your notes, there are also better and more optimized workflows to do it, too, I just did what is the easiest and fastest way for me. In the future, Iâ€™ll continue to improve this workflow, hopefully soon ðŸ˜Š.
