According to a study by McKinsey Global Institute, AI would create an additional 13 to $22 trillion of value annually by 2033. 
* Of this 13 to 22 trillion to $4,000,000,000,000 is predicted to come from generative AI.
* The larger portion of the value is predicted to be from other forms of AI, e.g. supervised learning technology. 

AI is already creating **tremendous amounts of value in the software industry**. The McKinsey study points out that a lot of the value in the future lies outside the software industry, e.g. *retail, travel, transportation, automotive materials manufacturing, etc*. 
## Categories of Artificial Intelligence
1. **ANI (artificial narrow intelligence):** AIs that are designed and trained to perform **one specific** task or set of tasks proficiently (narrow task) but **lack general intelligence or self-awareness**. e.g. smart speakers, self-driving cars, image recognition, etc. 
2. **Generative AI:** an AI technology that can produce high-quality content, such as text, images, audio, or code. Generative models learn patterns in input data (training data) and generate new, similar data. e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, Midjourney, DAL-E. 
	* This is a bit *more general purpose*. Chat GPT can be a copy editor, brainstorming partner, text summarizer, etc. 
3. **AGI (artificial general intelligence):** a ***hypothetical*** AI system that could **perform any intellectual tasks that a human can**, and maybe more.
	* AI research is taking small steps to achieve AGI, but realistically, we are still very far from AGI. No AGI system exists yet and it may take many technological breakthroughs before we get there. 

> The rapid progress in ANI and generative AI has caused people to conclude that there’s a lot of progress in AGI, which leads to overblown and unnecessary fears about sentient robots taking over humanity.
