**I am not a Python expert**. I am a web developer and have been using mostly JavaScript and TypeScript in my past work experience. However, I use Python for my coding interviews. Its concise syntax and dynamic typing (a blessing and a curse ðŸ˜…) make it perfect for quickly writing solutions to coding problems under pressure. 

This document should serve as a **quick guide to Python**, introducing you to the syntax and basic components that youâ€™d need when using Python for coding interviews. It is **not a comprehensive** guide to Python, youâ€™d need more than this to build an entire software with Python. 
## 1. Variables
Python is a **dynamically typed** programming language, **data type is determined at run time**. So unlike other statically typed languages like C++ or Java, you donâ€™t need to declare the data type, at all!
```python
n = 0 # no need to specify data type 
print("n = ", n) # output: n = 0

n = "abc" # reassigned data type to string
print("n = ", n) # output: n = abc

# multiple assignments. syntax: variable1 variable2: value1, value2
n, m = 0, "abc" 
n, m, z = 0.125, "abc", False
```

**Incrementing** in Python is a little bit different: 
```python
n = n + 1 # good
n+= 1     # good
n++       # syntax error -> cannot be done
```

Python doesnâ€™t use `null` for an absence of value, it uses **`None`**. 
```python
n = 4
n = None
print("n = ", n) # output: n = None
```
## 2. Conditional Statements
Python doesn't use parentheses or curly braces. Instead, it relies on **indentation** to define code blocks. This syntax may be confusing for beginners (it definitely was for me ðŸ˜…).
```python
n = 1
if n > 2:
	n-= 1 # this code belongs to the if block
elif n == 2: 
	n *= 2 # this code belongs to the elif (else if) block
else: 
	n +=2 # this code belongs to the else block
```

**`and` = `&&`**
**`or` == `||`**
```python
# parenthese are needed for multi-line conditions
n, m = 1, 2
if ((n > 2 and
	 n! m) or n == m):
	n += 1
```
## 3. Loops
```python
# while loops are relatively straightforward
n = 5
while n < 5 
	print(n)
	n += 1 
```
