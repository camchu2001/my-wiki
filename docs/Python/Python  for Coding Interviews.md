**I am not a Python expert**. I am a web developer and have been using mostly JavaScript and TypeScript in my past work experience. However, I use Python for my coding interviews. Its concise syntax and dynamic typing (a blessing and a curse ðŸ˜…) make it perfect for quickly writing solutions to coding problems under pressure. 

This document should serve as a **quick guide to Python**, introducing you to the syntax and basic components that youâ€™d need when using Python for coding interviews. It is **not a comprehensive** guide to Python, youâ€™d need more than this to build an entire software with Python.
