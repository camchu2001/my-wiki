**I am not a Python expert**. I am a web developer and have been using mostly JavaScript and TypeScript in my past work experience. 

However, I use Python to prepare for my coding interviews. I think Python definitely has an edge over other languages when it comings to coding interviews. If youâ€™re thinking about which language to use for coding interviews, Iâ€™d definitely recommend **Python**, although I wouldnâ€™t recommend it web development ðŸ˜…~

> **Resource:** [Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K_eZGS5NsU). 
> Honestly such a great summary for learning how to use Python in coding interviews. Neetcode is such a great channel when youâ€™re preparing yourself for coding interview. Highly recommend!
