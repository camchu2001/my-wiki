### 1. Unions
The `UNION` operator combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. It **removes duplicate rows** between the various `SELECT` statements and returns only distinct rows. If you want to include duplicates, you can use `UNION ALL`.

> The result sets from each `SELECT` statement are essentially **stacked on top of each other**. Each result set contributes its rows to a combined result set, maintaining the column structure defined in the SELECT statements.

```sql
-- SYNTAX for UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

<u>**Example 1**</u>: Find a list of employee and branch names. 
```sql
SELECT first_name 
FROM employee; 
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch; 
```
#### Rules and Considerations
1. **Same Number of Columns**: All `SELECT` statements in a `UNION` must have the same number of columns in the result sets.
```sql
-- This will result in an error because the number of columns does not match.
SELECT name, department FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM branches; 
```
2. **Similar Data Types**: The columns from each `SELECT` statement must have compatible data types. If they are not compatible, an error will occur.
```sql
-- This will result in an error if hire_date is a date and salary is numeric.
SELECT hire_date FROM employees
UNION
SELECT salary FROM employees; 
```
3. **Column Names and Order**: The column names in the result set are taken from the **first** `SELECT` statement.
```sql
SELECT name AS employee_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM branches;
```
â†’ The column name in the result set will be `employee_name` because it is specified in the first `SELECT` statement.

4. `UNION ALL` is generally faster than `UNION` because it does not perform the additional step of removing duplicates. Use `UNION ALL` if you do not need to eliminate duplicates and want to optimize performance.
