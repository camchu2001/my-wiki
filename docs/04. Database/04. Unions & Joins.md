### 1. Unions
The `UNION` operator combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. It **removes duplicate rows** between the various `SELECT` statements and returns only distinct rows. If you want to include duplicates, you can use `UNION ALL`.
```sql
-- SYNTAX for UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

<u>**Example 1**</u>: Find a list of employee and branch names. 
```sql
SELECT first_name 
FROM employee; 
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch; 
```
#### Rules and Considerations
1. **Same Number of Columns**: All SELECT statements in a UNION must have the same number of columns in the result sets.
