SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases by interacting with the RDBMS. It serves multiple purposes:
- Data management: Create, retrieve, update, and delete data
- Database administration: Create and manage databases, design tables, and perform administrative tasks

While SQL follows a standard, implementations may vary between relational database management systems (RDBMS). The core concepts remain consistent, but syntax and features can differ.

SQL is versatile, functioning as four languages in one:
1. **Data Query Language (DQL):** Retrieve information
2. **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Define database schemas
3. **Data Control Language (DCL):** Manage access and permissions
4. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Insert, update, and delete data
### Queries
A **query** is a set of SQL instructions that tell the database management system what information to retrieve or what action to perform.
