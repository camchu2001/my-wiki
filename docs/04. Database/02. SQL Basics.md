**SQL** is a language used to interact with the relational database management system (RDBMS). You can use SQL to: 
- Create, retrieve, update & delete data
- Create & manage databases
- Design & create database tables
- Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc.)

SQL implementations vary between systems and not all RDBMS follow the same SQL standard. The concepts are the same, but the implementation may vary. 

SQL is a hybrid language with 4 types of languages in one: 
- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: to query the database for information.
- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** for defining database schemas. 
- **Data Control Language (DCL):** for controlling access to the data in the database, user and permissions management.  
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: for inserting, updating, and deleting data from the database.
