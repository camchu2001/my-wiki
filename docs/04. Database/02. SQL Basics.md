**SQL** is a language used to interact with the relational database management system (RDBMS). You can use SQL to: 
- Create, retrieve, update & delete data
- Create & manage databases
- Design & create database tables
- Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc.)

SQL implementations vary between systems and not all RDBMS follow the same SQL standard. The concepts are the same, but the implementation may vary.
