> A **database** is an organized collection of structured information or data. Databases are managed by **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**, a software that provides an interface for users and applications to create, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently and securely.

### I. Database Management System (DBMS)
Itâ€™s a special software program that helps users create and maintain a database on a computer. It   
- makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
- handles security 
- does backups
- import/export data
- concurrency
- interacts with other software applications

The database management system is not the actual database, it is the software application that is creating, maintaining, updating, and deleting information from the actual database. 
### II. Two Types of Databases
#### 1. Relational Databases (SQL)
Organize data into more or more tables. 
- Each table has columns and rows. 
- A **unique** key identifies each row, e.g., `id`, `username`.

Popular Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are ***PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, etc.***

#### 2. Non-Relational (no SQL / not just SQL)
Organize data in anything but a traditional table. 
- Key-value stores
- Documents (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Graphs
- Flexible Tables
