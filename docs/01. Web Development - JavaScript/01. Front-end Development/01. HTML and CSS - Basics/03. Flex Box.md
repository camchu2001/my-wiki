**Flexbox** is a layout model that provides a more efficient way to arrange, align, and distribute space among items in a container using. These items will flex (grow or shrink) based on rules you can define. 
### 1. Flex Containers & Flex Items
* A **flex container** is the parent element that contains flex item and is styled with `display: flex`. 
* A **flex item** are is the children element that lives directly inside of a **flex container**, they can be aligned and distributed inside this container. Most of the time, we can have nested flex boxes, so a flex item may be a flex container, containing other flex items.

### 2. The `flex` property
The `flex` declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` that you can set on a flex item. These **properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container**. 
The `flex` property may be specified using one, two, or three values: 
* **One value**: which can be of the following
	* a value for `flex-grow` which is a positive number.
	* a value for `flex-basis` which can be a number, px, or `auto`.
* **Two values:** 
	* The first value must be a valid value for `flex-grow`
	* The second value must either be a valid value for `flex-shrink` or `flex-basis`.
* **Three values:** the values must be in the following order: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`

<u>***Example***</u>: The `flex: 1` declaration equates to: `flex-grow: 1`, `flex-shrink: 1`, `flex-basis: 0` = `flex: 1 1 0`.
```css
.flex-container{
	display: flex;
}
.flex-item {
	flex: 1;
}
```

1. **`flex-grow`**: expects a single number (not negative) as its value, this value is used as the flex item’s “*growth factor*”.  When we don’t specify the default value of `flex-grow` is `0`.
<u>***Example***</u>: 
* When we apply `flex: 1` to every `div`, we’re telling every `div` to grow the same amount. → every `div` is the same size. 
* When we apply `flex: 2` to one of the `divs`, that `div` will grow to 2x the size of others. 
```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="one"></div>
  <div class="two"></div>
  <div class="three"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.flex-grow {
  display: flex;
}

/* this selector selects all divs inside of .flex-container */
.flex-grow div {
  background: peachpuff;
  border: 4px solid brown;
  height: 100px;
  flex: 1 1 0%;
}

/* only div.two is selected here */
.flex-grow .two {
  flex: 2 1 0%;
}
```

2. **`flex-shrink`**: similar to `flex-grow`, but sets the “*shrink factor*” of a flex item. `flex-shrink` is only applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. → item will only shrink if the container is getting smaller than the item itself. 
	* The default shrink value is `flex-shrink: 1`, which means all items will shrink evenly. 
	* If you do not want an item to shrink, you must specify → `flex-shrink: 0`.

<u>***Example:***</u>
```html
<div class="flex-shrink">
  <div class="one"></div>
  <div class="two"></div>
  <div class="three"></div>
</div
```

```css
.flex-shrink {
  display: flex;
}

/* this selector selects all divs inside of .flex-container */
.flex-shrink div {
  background: peachpuff;
  border: 4px solid brown;
  height: 100px;
  width: 250px;
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}

.flex-shrink .two {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

> **Note**: When you specify `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink`, the flex items don’t necessarily respect your given values for `width`. **When the parent container is big, the items may grow bigger to fill it, when the parent container is too small, the default behavior is to shrink to fit.** 

3. **`flex-basis`**: sets the **initial size** of a flex item along the **main axis**, so any sort of `flex-grow` or `flex-shrink` starts from that baseline size. 
> In a Flex `row`, `flex-basis` does the same thing as `width`. In a Flex `column`, `flex-basis` does the same thing as `height`.
* When you specify `flex: 1` on an element → `flex-basis` defaults to `flex-basis: 0%`. 
* When you don’t specify `flex-basis`, the default value is `auto`.
* When we declare `flex-basis: auto`, we’re asking the item to check for a `width` declaration. (the previous example of `flex-shrink` does mention this).

→ Like we saw with `width`, `flex-basis` is **more of a suggestion than a hard constraint**. At a certain point, there just isn't enough space for all of the elements to sit at their assigned size, and so they have to compromise, in order to avoid an overflow.
### 3. `flex` property’s values
1. `initial`: the item is **sized according to the specified `width` and `height`** properties. 
* **shrinks to its minimum size to fit** the container, but does NOT grow to absorb any extra free space in the flex container. 
* This is equivalent to setting `flex: 0 1 auto`.
2. `auto`: the item is also **sized according to the specified `width` and `height`** properties.
* **grows to absorb any extra free space** in the flex container, and **shrinks to its minimum size to fit** the container.
* This is equivalent to setting `flex: 1 1 auto`.
3. `none`: the item is **sized according to its `width` and `height`** properties. 
* Fully **inflexible**: it *neither shrinks nor grows* in relation to the flex container. 
* This is equivalent to setting `flex: 0 0 auto`.

### 1. The `flex-direction` property - Axes
The orientation of items within a **flex container** can be controlled using the `flex-direction` property. A flexbox can work either horizontally or vertically, the default direction for a flex container is ***horizontally*** (or `row`) but you can always change this direction to ***vertical*** (or `column`).
```css
.flex-container{
	display: flex; 
	flex-direction: column;
}
```

A flex-container contains **2 axes**: the ***main axis*** and the ***cross axis***. When we declare the `flex-direction`, we are **changing the direction of the main axis**. The cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis, hence, it changes direction with the main axis when we declare `flex-direction`. ‘
Here are a few common values of `flex-direction`: 
* `flex-direction: row`: the **main axis goes from left - right** → the cross axis is now top - bottom. 
* `flex-direction: column`: the **main axis goes from top - bottom** → the cross axis is now left - right. 
* `flex-direction: row-reverse`: **the main axis goes from right - left.** 
* `flex-direction: column-reverse`: **the main axis goes from bottom-top.**

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |

> **Note**: By default, the `flex-direction: row` and `flex-basis` value refers to the `width` of an element. However, in a `column` flex-container, `flex-basis` refers to the `height`. This is because `flex-basis` refers to the size of the item along the main axis. Try this piece of code to see how `flex-direction: column` affects `flex: 1`.
> ```css
>  .flex-container {
> 	 display: flex; 
> 	 flex-direction: column; 
>  }
>  .flex-item{
>     height: 80px;
> 	flex: 1; 
> }
>```
> → Because `flex: 1` , that means `flex-basis: 0` → the initial `height` of the item is now set to 0, and the `div` collapses because there’s no `height` or `width` inside to fill the `div`.

> **Note**: `flex-direction` technically changes the direction and orientation of the main axis, to **change the direction of the cross axis (left → right, top → bottom), we can use `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`**, which will be further discussed in `flex-wrap` section. 

### 2. Alignment
> **Resources**
> - [`justify-content`](http://127.0.0.1:3000/01_foundations/03_flexbox/lessons/02_flex_box_axes_alignment/index.html)
> - [`align-items`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items)

Using `flex: 1` for the items makes each of the items grow to fill the available space in the flex container. But what if we want the flex items to stay with the width and height we give them, but distribute themselves differently within the container? We can **use alignment properties for the flex-container**. 

1. **`justify-content`**: ***aligns and distributes*** space among items across the **main axis.** This property can have the following common values: 
* <u>Positional</u>: 
	* `center`: aligns all items in the container to the center. 
	* `start`, `end`: aligns all items in the container to the start or end of the **main axis**.
	* `flex-start`, `flex-end`: does the same thing as `start` or `end`, but is affected by `flex-direction: -reverse`, when the flex direction changes
	* `left`, `right`: aligns all items in the container to the left or right.
* <u>Distributed Alignment</u>: 
	* `space-between`: **evenly distributes all items** within the flex container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent item is the same, however, the **first item is has no space with the main-start edge**, and the **last item is has no space with the main-end edge**.
	* `space-around`: **evenly distributes all items** within the container along the main axis, just like `space-between`. However, the difference is, the spacing between each pair of adjacent items are the same AND the empty space between the first item and after the last item equals half of the space between each pair of adjacent items. 
	* `space-evenly`: **evenly distributes all items** within the container along the main axis. However, the **spacing between each pair of adjacent items**, the **main-start edge and the first item**, and the **main-end edge and the last item**, are the same.
	* `stretch`: For [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox), the `stretch` value behaves as `flex-start` or `start`. This is because, in flexbox, stretching is controlled using the [`flex-grow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow) property.
2. `align-items`: **aligns and distributes** items across the **cross-axis**. This property can have the following common values: 
	* `center`: the flex items' margin boxes are **centered** within the line on the **cross-axis.**
	* `start`, `end`: the items are pushed to the **start/end edge of the alignment** container in the appropriate axis.
	* `flex-start`, `flex-end`: does the same thing as `start` or `end`, but is affected by `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`, when the flex-direction changes. 
	* `self-start`, `self-end`: 
	* `stretch`: If the items are smaller than the alignment container, **auto-sized items will be equally enlarged to fill the container**, respecting the items' width and height limits.

> **<u>Obvious Note</u>**: Because `justify-content` and `align-items` are based on the main and cross-axis of your container, their behavior changes when you change the `flex-direction` of a flex-container.
### 3. Gap - the `gap` property
The `gap` on a flex container adds a specified space between flex items, similar to adding margin to the items themselves. 
```css
.flex-container{
	gap: 5px;
}
```
### 4. The `flex-wrap` property
The **`flex-wrap`** property sets whether flex items are **forced onto one line** or can **wrap onto multiple lines**. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked. The `flex-wrap` property can have the following values: 
1. `nowrap`: this is the default value. The flex items are laid out in a **single line** which may cause the flex container to **overflow**.
2. `wrap`: The flex items break into multiple lines.
3. `wrap-reverse`: Behaves the same as `wrap` but **cross-axis start** and **cross-axis end** are permuted.
