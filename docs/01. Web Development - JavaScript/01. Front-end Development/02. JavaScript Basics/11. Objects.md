There are eight data types in JavaScript, seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain a single thing. In contrast, objects are used to stored **keyed collections of various data** and more complex entities. 

An object can be create with `{...}` with an optional list of **properties***. A property is a `key: value` pair, where `key`, or property name - is a string, and `value` can be anything. 
An **empty object** can be created using one of two syntaxes:
```js
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax
```

A property has a key before the colon `:` and a value to the right of if. 
```js
let user = {        // an object
  name: "John",     // the value "John" is stored in a key named "name"
  age: 30           // value 30 is stored in a key named age
};
```
We can also use **multiword property name, but they most be quoted**: 
```js
let user = {
  name: "John", 
  age: 30, 
  "likes birds": true
};
```
## 1. Object Property
### 1. Set a property
```js
user.isAdmin = true; 
```
### 2. Remove a property
```js
delete user.age;
```
### 3. Access property values
* Property **values** are accessible using the **dot notation**. 
```js
console.log(user.name); // John
console.log(user.age); // 30
```
### 4. Square brackets
* For **multiword properties** with whitespaces, the *dot access doesn’t work*. Instead, we can use an alternative **square bracket notation** that works with any string:
```js
let user = {}; 

// set
user["likes birds"] = true; 

// get
console.log(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete 
delete user["likes birds"]; 
```
* Square brackets can provide a way to **obtain the property name** as the result of any expression that the **dot notation cannot do**: 
```js
let user = {
  name: "John", 
  age: 30
}; 

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?"); 

console.log(user[key]); // John (if 'name' was entered)
```
* We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object → **computed properties**. 
```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?"); 

let bag = {
  [fruit + "Computers"]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
}

console.log(bag.appleComputers); // 5 if fruit is apple
```
### 5. Property value shorthand
```js
function makeUser(name, age){
  return {
    name: name, 
    age: age,
    // ... other properties
  }
}
```

In the example above, **properties have the same names as variables**. There’s a special *property value shorthand* to make this shorter. 
```js
function makeUser(name, age){
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age, // same as age:age
  }
}
```
Both normal properties and shorthands in the same object is possible: 
```js
let user{
  name, // name: name
  age: 30
}
```
### 6. Property names limitation
A variable cannot have a name equal to one of the **language-reserved** words like “`for`”, “`let`”, “`return`” etc. **But for an object property, there’s no such restriction**. In short, there are no limitations on property names, they can be ***any strings or symbols.***

```js
// these properties are all ok
let obj = {
  for: 1, 
  let: 2, 
  return: 3
}
console.log(obj.for + obj.let + obj.return); // 6
```

Other types are automatically converted to strings: 
A number `0` becomes a string `"0"` when used as a property key:
```js
let obj = {
  0: "test" // "0": "test"
};
// both logs access the same property
console.log(obj["0"]); 
console.log(obj[0]); 
```
### 7. Check property existence - `in` operator
* We we read a non-existing property, it’ll return `undefined`. So **checking for `undefined`** can be a way to see if the property exists. 
```js
let user = {}; 

console.log(user.noSuchProperty === undefined); // true
```
* We can also use the **special operator `in`** for that: 
```js
// syntax
// the left side must be a quoted string of property name/key
"key" in object

// example
let user = {
  name: "John", 
  age : 30
}; 
console.log("age" in user); // true
console.log("blabla" in user); // false
```
#### 1. `for...in` loop
It's commonly used to **iterate over the enumerable properties of objects**.
```js
// syntax
for (keyName in object){
 //... code
}
```

```js
// example
let user = {
  name: "John", 
  age: 30, 
  isAdmin: true
}; 

for (let key in user){
  console.log(key); // name, age, isAdmin
  console.log(user[key]); // John, 30, true
}
```
#### 2. Objects Sort Order
Keys that are **integers** are sorted in **ascending order**, **other keys** are sorted in **creation order.** 
```js
// example
// integer properties 
let codes = {
  "49": "Germany", 
  "41": "Switzerland",  
  "44": "Great Britain", 
  //...,
  "1": "USA"
}; 

for (let code in codes){
  console.log(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49 -> sorted in ascending order
}

// non-integer
let user = {
  name: "John", 
  surname: "Smith"
}; 

user.age = 25; 

for(let prop in user){
  console.log(prop); // name, surname, age -> creation order
}
```
→ In this example, to fix the issue with the phone codes, we can “cheat” by making the codes non-integer. Adding a plus `"+"` sign before each code is enough.
