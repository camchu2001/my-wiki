There are eight data types in JavaScript, seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain a single thing. In contrast, objects are used to stored **keyed collections of various data** and more complex entities. 
An object can be create with `{...}` with an optional list of **properties***. A property is a `key: value` pair, where `key`, or property name - is a string, and `value` can be anything. 
An empty object can be created using one of two syntaxes:
```js
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax
```
## 1. Literals and Properties
```js
let user = {        // an object
  name: "John",     // the value "John" is stored in a key named "name"
  age: 30           // value 30 is stored in a key named age
};
```
A property has a key before the colon `:` and a value to the right of if. We can also use **multiword property name, but they most be quoted**: 
```js
let user = {
  name: "John", 
  age: 30, 
  "likes birds": true
};
```
### 1. Operations 
#### 1. Set a property
```js
user.isAdmin = true; 
```
#### 2. Remove a property
```js
delete user.age;
```
#### 3. Access property values
* Property **values** are accessible using the **dot notation**. 
```js
console.log(user.name); // John
console.log(user.age); // 30
```
#### 4. Square Brackets
* For **multiword properties** with whitespaces, the *dot access doesn’t work*. Instead, we can use an alternative **square bracket notation** that works with any string:
```js
let user = {}; 

// set
user["likes birds"] = true; 

// get
console.log(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete 
delete user["likes birds"]; 
```
* Square brackets can provide a way to **obtain the property name** as the result of any expression that the **dot notation cannot do**: 
```js
let user = {
  name: "John", 
  age: 30
}; 

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?"); 

console.log(user[key]); // John (if 'name' was entered)
```
* We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object → **computed properties**. 
```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?"); 

let bag = {
  [fruit + "Computers"]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
}

console.log(bag.appleComputers); // 5 if fruit is apple
```
### 2. Property Value Shorthand
```js
function makeUser(name, age){
  return {
    name: name, 
    age: age,
    // ... other properties
  }
}
```
