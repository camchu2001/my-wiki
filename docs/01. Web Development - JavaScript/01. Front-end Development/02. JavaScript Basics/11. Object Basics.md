There are eight data types in JavaScript, seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain a single thing. In contrast, objects are used to stored **keyed collections of various data** and more complex entities. 
An object can be create with `{...}` with an optional list of **properties***. A property is a `key: value` pair, where `key`, or property name - is a string, and `value` can be anything. 
An empty object can be created using one of two syntaxes:
```js
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {}; // "object literal" syntax
```
