### 1. `form` element
The **`<form>`** element is a container element that wraps all inputs a user will interact with on a form. The `form` element can accept two essential attributes : 
- `action` attribute takes a URL value, telling the form where it should send its data to be processed.
- `method` attribute tells the browser which HTTP request method to submit the form. e.g. GET, POST. 
```html
<form action="example.com/path" method="post"></form>
```
### 2. `input` element
The **`input`** element accepts a `type` attribute, which tells the browser what *type* of data it should expect and how it should render the input element. 
```html
<form action="example.com/path" method="post">
  <input type="text">
</form>
```
The **`<input>`** element can have various types specified through the `type` attribute. Commonly used types are: 
1. **`text`**: This is the *default* type if no `type` attribute is specified. It creates a single-line text input field for users to enter text.
2. **`password`**: This type creates a single-line text input field where the *characters entered are masked* (e.g., displayed as dots or asterisks) for security purposes, typically used for password inputs.
3. **`email`**: This type creates a single-line text input field specifically for entering email addresses. Some browsers may apply additional *validation or formatting for email inputs*.
4. **`number`**: This type creates a single-line text input field that accepts *only numerical values*. Browsers may provide up/down arrows or a number picker for easy value selection.
5. **`checkbox`**: This type creates a checkbox input that *can be toggled on or off*.
6. **`radio`**: This type creates a *radio button input* that allows selecting one option from a group of related options.
7. **`file`**: This type creates a *file input field* that allows users to select one or more files from their local file system for uploading.
8. **`date`**: This type creates an input field specifically for entering a date. Browsers may provide a date picker or calendar for easy date selection.
9. **`time`**: This type creates an input field specifically for entering a time value.
10. **`submit`**: This type creates a submit button that, when clicked, submits the form data to the server specified in the `action` attribute.
11. **`hidden`**: This type creates an invisible input field that can be used to store data that should be submitted with the form but not visible to the user.
12. **`search`**: This type creates a single-line text input field for entering search queries. Browsers may provide specific styling or functionality for search inputs.
### 3. `label` element
We can give labels to our inputs using the **`<label>`** element to inform users what type of data they are expected to enter. 
```html
<form action="example.com/path" method="post">
  <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="first_name">
</form>
```
Labels accept a `for` attribute, which associates it with a particular input. The input we want to associate with a label needs an `id` attribute with the same value as the label’s `for` attribute.
→ When a label is associated with an input and is clicked, it will focus the cursor on that input, ready for the user to input some data.
### 4. `placeholder` attribute
To guide users on what to enter in form elements, we can add a `placeholder` attribute to an input. The value will be the _placeholder_ text we want to display in the input:
```html
<label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="first_name" placeholder="Bob...">
```
### 5. `name` attribute
