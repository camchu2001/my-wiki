The **grid** is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex and responsive grid-based designs. It provides a way to **divide the web page into rows and column**s, making it easier to position and align elements.
### 1. Grid container
We can think about CSS Grid in terms of a container and items. When you make an element a grid container, it will “contain” the whole grid. In CSS, an element is turned into a grid container with the property `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid`.

> **Note:** Only the direct child elements will become grid items here. If we had another element as a child under one of _these_ child elements it would not be a grid item.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2
    <p>I am not a grid item!</p>
  </div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```
