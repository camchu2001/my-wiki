The **grid** is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex and responsive grid-based designs. It provides a way to **divide the web page into rows and column**s, making it easier to position and align elements.
## I. Introduction to Grid
### 1. Setting up a Grid
#### 1. Grid container
We can think about CSS Grid in terms of a **container** and **items**. When you make an element a grid container, it will “contain” the whole grid. In CSS, an element is turned into a grid container with the property **`display: grid`** or **`display: inline-grid`**.

> **Note:** Only the **direct child elements** will become grid items here. If we had another element as a child under one of _these_ child elements it would not be a grid item.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2
    <p>I am not a grid item!</p>
  </div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```
#### 2. Columns and Rows
**Columns** are the vertical tracks in a grid layout. They are defined using the **`grid-template-columns`** property.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 300px; 
  /* Three column tracks with widths 200px, 100px, and 300px */
}
```

Rows are the horizontal tracks in a grid layout. They are defined using the **`grid-template-rows`** property.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 100px auto; 
  /* Three row tracks with heights 50px, 100px, and auto */
}
```

The **`grid-template`** property is a shorthand for defining **both columns and rows** together. The columns are specified after the forward-slash (`/`), and the rows are defined before the slash.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: 50px 100px / 200px 50px 100px; 
  /* Two row tracks (50px, 100px) and three column tracks (200px, 50px, 100px) */
}
```
