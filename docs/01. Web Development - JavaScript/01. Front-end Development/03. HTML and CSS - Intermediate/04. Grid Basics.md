The **grid** is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex and responsive grid-based designs. It provides a way to **divide the web page into rows and column**s, making it easier to position and align elements.

### 1. Setting up a Grid
#### 1. Grid container
We can think about CSS Grid in terms of a **container** and **items**. When you make an element a grid container, it will “contain” the whole grid. In CSS, an element is turned into a grid container with the property **`display: grid`** or **`display: inline-grid`**.

> **Note:** Only the **direct child elements** will become grid items here. If we had another element as a child under one of _these_ child elements it would not be a grid item.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2
    <p>I am not a grid item!</p>
  </div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```
#### 2. Columns and Rows

| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|                                          |                                          |

**Columns** are the vertical tracks in a grid layout. They are defined using the **`grid-template-columns`** property.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 300px; 
  /* Three column tracks with widths 200px, 100px, and 300px */
}
```

**Rows** are the horizontal tracks in a grid layout. They are defined using the **`grid-template-rows`** property.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 100px auto; 
  /* Three row tracks with heights 50px, 100px, and auto */
}
```

The **`grid-template`** property is a shorthand for defining **both columns and rows** together. The columns are specified after the forward-slash (`/`), and the rows are defined before the slash.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: 50px 100px / 200px 50px 100px; 
  /* Two row tracks (50px, 100px) and three column tracks (200px, 50px, 100px) */
}
```
### 2. Explicit vs. Implicit Grid
> **Resource**
> - [Implicit vs. Explicit Tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_153Zz4YI8&ab_channel=WesBos)

**Explicit grid tracks** are the ones you define directly using the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties. These properties allow you to specify the size and number of columns and rows in your grid layout.

**Implicit grid tracks** are automatically created by the grid layout when there are more grid items than the explicit grid tracks can accommodate. These implicit tracks are added as needed to fit the extra grid items. By default, the size of implicit grid tracks is determined by the `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns` properties.
```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 30px 100px; /* Two explicit row tracks */
    grid-auto-rows: 80px; /* Size of implicit row tracks */
}
```
### 3. Gap
![](https://i.imgur.com/oI4E1II.png)

The **gap** between grid rows and columns is known as the gutter or alley. Gap sizes can be adjusted separately for rows and columns using the `column-gap` and `row-gap` properties. 
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
  row-gap: 20px; /* Gap between rows */
  column-gap: 30px; /* Gap between columns */
}
```

Furthermore, we can use a shorthand property called `gap` to set both `row-gap` and `column-gap`.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
  gap: 20px 30px; /* row-gap: 20px, column-gap: 30px */
}
```
## II. Positioning Grid Items

### 1. Grid Lines
![](https://i.imgur.com/NEsQwma.png)

**Grid lines** are the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid into rows and columns, respectively. They are created implicitly when you define grid tracks (rows and columns) and they cannot be explicitly created. 
Grid lines are numbered starting from 1, and they are used to position grid items within the grid layout. They are what we use to position grid items.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 100px; /* Creates 3 vertical grid lines (1, 2, 3) */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Creates 3 horizontal grid lines (1, 2, 3) */
}
```
### 2. Grid Cells
A **grid cell** is the intersection of a row track and a column track. It represents a single unit of space within the grid layout. Each grid cell can contain one or more grid items, depending on how the items are positioned and sized.
### 3. Positioning
- **grid-column-start**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should start in the grid column. The grid lines are numbered from **1 (for the start edge of the grid) to (n+1) (for the end edge).**
- **grid-column-end**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should end in the grid column.
- **grid-column**: This shorthand property sets both the `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` in a single declaration.
```css
.item {
  grid-column-start: 2; /* Start at the 2nd grid line */
  grid-column-end: 4; /* End at the 4th grid line */
}

/* equivalent to */
.item {
  grid-column: 2 / 4; /* Start at the 2nd line, end at the 4th line */
}
```

- **grid-row-start**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should start in the grid row.
- **grid-row-end**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should end in the grid row.
- **grid-row**: This shorthand property sets both the `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` in a single declaration.
```css
.item {
  grid-row-start: 1; /* Start at the 1st grid line */
  grid-row-end: 3; /* End at the 3rd grid line */
}

/* equivalent to */
.item {
  grid-row: 1 / 3; /* Start at the 1st line, end at the 3rd line */
}
```
### 4. `grid-area`
The `grid-area` property is a shorthand property that defines a grid item's position and size within the grid container. It can be used in two different ways:
#### 1. Positioning with Grid Line Numbers
- The **`grid-area`** property can be used to specify the grid lines where the grid item should start and end, both horizontally and vertically.
- The syntax is **`grid-area: row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end;`**
```css
.item {
  grid-area: 1 / 2 / 4 / 6; /* Starts at row 1, column 2; ends at row 4, column 6 */
}
```
#### 2. Naming Grid Areas
- The **`grid-area`** property can also be used to **assign a name** to a grid item.
- This name can then be *referenced* in the **`grid-template-areas`** property of the grid container to define the layout of the grid visually.

In the example, the grid layout is defined using the named grid areas, and the period (`.`) represents an empty cell in the grid.
```css
.living-room {
    grid-column: living-room
}

.kitchen {
    grid-area: kitchen;
}

.toilet {
    grid-area: toilet;
}

.closet {
    grid-area: closet;
}

.container {
  /* grid */
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 20vw auto 15vw;
    grid-template-rows: 20vh 40vh auto;

    /* naming grid-areas  */
    grid-template-areas:
        "living-room living-room living-room"
        "kitchen bedroom toilet"
        "kitchen closet toilet";
}
```

## III. Other Grid Properties
### 1. `resize`
The **`resize`** property is used to specify whether an element is **resizable by the user**, and if so, in **what direction(s)** it can be resized.
* **`none`**: the default value, the element cannot be resized by the user.
* **`both`**: allows the user to resize the element **both** horizontally and vertically by dragging the element’s bottom-right corner.
* **`horizontal`**: allows the user to resize the element horizontally by dragging the element’s right edge.
* **`vertical`**: allows the user to resize the element vertically by dragging the element’s bottom edge. 
### 2 `repeat()`
The **`repeat()`** function is used in the CSS Grid Layout module. It’s used to create repeating patterns of grid tracks (rows or columns) within a grid container.
```
repeat(repetitions, size)
```
