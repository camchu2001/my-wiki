The **grid** is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex and responsive grid-based designs. It provides a way to **divide the web page into rows and columns**, making it easier to position and align elements.

### 1. Setting up a Grid
#### 1. Grid container
We can think about CSS Grid in terms of a **container** and **items**. When you make an element a grid container, it will “contain” the whole grid. In CSS, an element is turned into a grid container with the property **`display: grid`** or **`display: inline-grid`**.

> **Note:** Only the **direct child elements** will become grid items here. If we had another element as a child under one of _these_ child elements it would not be a grid item.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2
    <p>I am not a grid item!</p>
  </div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```
#### 2. Columns and Rows

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
|                                      |                                      |

**Columns** are the vertical tracks in a grid layout. They are defined using the **`grid-template-columns`** property.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 300px; 
  /* Three column tracks with widths 200px, 100px, and 300px */
}
```

**Rows** are the horizontal tracks in a grid layout. They are defined using the **`grid-template-rows`** property.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 100px auto; 
  /* Three row tracks with heights 50px, 100px, and auto */
}
```

The **`grid-template`** property is a shorthand for defining **both columns and rows** together. The columns are specified after the forward-slash (`/`), and the rows are defined before the slash.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: 50px 100px / 200px 50px 100px; 
  /* Two row tracks (50px, 100px) and three column tracks (200px, 50px, 100px) */
}
```
### 2. Explicit vs. Implicit Grid
> **Resource**
> - [Implicit vs. Explicit Tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_153Zz4YI8&ab_channel=WesBos)

**Explicit grid tracks** are the ones you define directly using the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties. These properties allow you to specify the size and number of columns and rows in your grid layout.

**Implicit grid tracks** are automatically created by the grid layout when there are more grid items than the explicit grid tracks can accommodate. These implicit tracks are added as needed to fit the extra grid items. By default, the size of implicit grid tracks is determined by the `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns` properties.
```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 30px 100px; /* Two explicit row tracks */
    grid-auto-rows: 80px; /* Size of implicit row tracks */
}
```
### 3. Gap
![](https://i.imgur.com/oI4E1II.png)

The **gap** between grid rows and columns is known as the gutter or alley. Gap sizes can be adjusted separately for rows and columns using the `column-gap` and `row-gap` properties. 
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
  row-gap: 20px; /* Gap between rows */
  column-gap: 30px; /* Gap between columns */
}
```

Furthermore, we can use a shorthand property called `gap` to set both `row-gap` and `column-gap`.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
  gap: 20px 30px; /* row-gap: 20px, column-gap: 30px */
}
```
## II. Positioning Grid Items
> **Resource**
> - [Line-based Placement with CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_layout_using_line-based_placement)
### 1. Grid Lines
![](https://i.imgur.com/NEsQwma.png)

**Grid lines** are the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid into rows and columns, respectively. They are created implicitly when you define grid tracks (rows and columns) and they cannot be explicitly created. 
Grid lines are numbered starting from 1, and they are used to position grid items within the grid layout. They are what we use to position grid items.
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 100px; /* Creates 3 vertical grid lines (1, 2, 3) */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Creates 3 horizontal grid lines (1, 2, 3) */
}
```
### 2. Grid Cells
A **grid cell** is the intersection of a row track and a column track. It represents a single unit of space within the grid layout. Each grid cell can contain one or more grid items, depending on how the items are positioned and sized.
### 3. Positioning
- **grid-column-start**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should start in the grid column. The grid lines are numbered from **1 (for the start edge of the grid) to (n+1) (for the end edge).**
- **grid-column-end**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should end in the grid column.
- **grid-column**: This shorthand property sets both the `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` in a single declaration.
```css
.item {
  grid-column-start: 2; /* Start at the 2nd grid line */
  grid-column-end: 4; /* End at the 4th grid line */
}

/* equivalent to */
.item {
  grid-column: 2 / 4; /* Start at the 2nd line, end at the 4th line */
}
```

- **grid-row-start**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should start in the grid row.
- **grid-row-end**: This property specifies the grid line where the item should end in the grid row.
- **grid-row**: This shorthand property sets both the `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` in a single declaration.
```css
.item {
  grid-row-start: 1; /* Start at the 1st grid line */
  grid-row-end: 3; /* End at the 3rd grid line */
}

/* equivalent to */
.item {
  grid-row: 1 / 3; /* Start at the 1st line, end at the 3rd line */
}
```
### 4. `grid-area`
The `grid-area` property is a shorthand property that defines a grid item's position and size within the grid container. It can be used in two different ways:
#### 1. Positioning with Grid Line Numbers
- The **`grid-area`** property can be used to specify the grid lines where the grid item should start and end, both horizontally and vertically.
- The syntax is **`grid-area: row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end;`**
```css
.item {
  grid-area: 1 / 2 / 4 / 6; /* Starts at row 1, column 2; ends at row 4, column 6 */
}
```
#### 2. Naming Grid Areas
- The **`grid-area`** property can also be used to **assign a name** to a grid item.
- This name can then be *referenced* in the **`grid-template-areas`** property of the grid container to define the layout of the grid visually.

In the example, the grid layout is defined using the named grid areas, and the period (`.`) represents an empty cell in the grid.
```css
.living-room {
    grid-column: living-room
}

.kitchen {
    grid-area: kitchen;
}

.toilet {
    grid-area: toilet;
}

.closet {
    grid-area: closet;
}

.container {
  /* grid */
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 20vw auto 15vw;
    grid-template-rows: 20vh 40vh auto;

    /* naming grid-areas  */
    grid-template-areas:
        "living-room living-room living-room"
        "kitchen bedroom toilet"
        "kitchen closet toilet";
}
```

## III. Other Grid Properties
> **Resource**
> - [Grid Properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-properties)
### 1. Fractional Units
The most basic way to make grid items dynamic is by using **fractional units** (**`fr`**). This unit distributes the remaining space in a grid container after allocating space to any grid tracks with a fixed size. When multiple grid tracks are assigned `fr` values, the available space is divided according to the ratio of those `fr` values.
```css
/* All columns have equal width */
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;

/* The second column is three times wider than the others */
grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;

/* A mix of fixed and fractional sizes */
grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 150px 2fr;
```
### 2. `resize`
The **`resize`** property is used to specify whether an element is **resizable by the user**, and if so, in **what direction(s)** it can be resized.
* **`none`**: the default value, the element cannot be resized by the user.
* **`both`**: allows the user to resize the element **both** horizontally and vertically by dragging the element’s bottom-right corner.
* **`horizontal`**: allows the user to resize the element horizontally by dragging the element’s right edge.
* **`vertical`**: allows the user to resize the element vertically by dragging the element’s bottom edge. 
```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    resize: both;
    overflow: auto; /* to enable scrolling if we resize the container to be smaller than our grid can accommodate */
}
```
### 3 .`repeat()`
The **`repeat()`** **function** is used to create **repeating patterns** of grid tracks (rows or columns) within a grid container.
```
repeat(repetitions, size)
```
* **`repetitions`**: This can be either a positive integer value representing the number of times to repeat the track size, or the keyword `auto-fill` or `auto-fit`.
* **`size`**: This can be a length value (e.g., `20px`, `1fr`), a percentage value, or a flexible length (`minmax(min, max)`).

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 200px);
/* Creates 4 columns, each with a width of 200px */

grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 150px) repeat(3, 100px); 
/* Creates 5 columns: 2 with width 150px, followed by 3 with flexible width of 1fr */
```

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
/* Creates as many columns as possible with a minimum width of 200px and a maximum width of 1fr, based on the available space */

grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, auto));
/* Creates as many rows as needed to fit the content, with a minimum height of 100px and a maximum height determined by the content */
```
### 4. Minimum and Maximum Track Sizes
<u>**Example**</u>: The grid rows will have a size of `100px`, the smallest value from the list (`100px`, `200px`, `300px`, `400px`, `500px`).

Example: A grid with 2 rows and 5 columns. The row heights will be either `200px` or `50%` of the container's height (whichever is smaller), and the column widths will be either `120px` or `15%` of the container's width (whichever is larger).

```css
.grid-container {
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, min(200px, 50%));
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, max(120px, 15%));
}
```
### 5. Dynamic Minimum and Maximum Sizes
#### 1. `minmax()`
This function is specifically used with Grid Layout. It **defines a size range for grid tracks**, allowing them to grow or shrink within a specified minimum and maximum size. 

**Syntax**: `minmax(min-size, max-size)`.
- `min-size`: The minimum size the grid track can be. It can be a length value (e.g., `150px`) or a flexible value like `min-content`, `max-content`, or a percentage.
- `max-size`: The maximum size the grid track can be. It can be a length value (e.g., `200px`) or a flexible value like `min-content`, `max-content`, or a percentage.

The function is used with the following CSS properties:
- `grid-template-columns`
- `grid-template-rows`
- `grid-auto-columns`
- `grid-auto-rows`

<u>**Example**</u>: The grid container will have 5 columns, and each column track will have a minimum width of `150px` and a maximum width of `200px`. 
* If the grid container is wider, the column tracks will grow up to `200px`, but not beyond that.
* If the grid container is narrower, the column tracks will shrink down to `150px`, but not smaller.
```css
.grid-container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, minmax(150px, 200px));
}
```
#### 2. [`clamp()`](https://main--camchuwiki.netlify.app/Web%20Development%20-%20JavaScript/Front-end%20Development/HTML%20and%20CSS%20-%20Intermediate/Intermediate%20CSS#5-clamp)
This function allows **constraining a value within a specified range**.

**Syntax**: `clamp(min-size, ideal-size, max-size)`
- `min-size`: The minimum size the element can be.
- `ideal-size`: The preferred size the element should be if possible.
- `max-size`: The maximum size the element can be.

The function can be used anywhere, not just within a grid container, such as `width`, `height`, `font-size`, `padding`, `margin`, etc.

<u>**Example**</u>: The grid container will have 5 column tracks. Initially, each column track will try to be `20%` of the container’s width (preferred value). 
* If the `20%` width is less than `150px`, the column tracks will be set to `150px`. 
* If `20%` of the container’s width is greater than `200px`, the column tracks will be set to `200px`.
```css
.grid-container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, clamp(150px, 20%, 200px));
}
```
### 6. `auto-fit` and `auto-fill` 
> **Resource**
> - [CSS Grid - auto-fit and auto-fill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asfqwwrXis4)
> - [CSS Grid: Using minmax() for Responsive Grids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuhObGdKSDs)
#### 1. `auto-fit`
**`auto-fit`** is a value used with the `repeat()` function. It **creates as many grid tracks (rows or columns) as possible** while respecting the `max-content` size of the grid items, not overflowing the grid container, and stretching the remaining grid tracks to fill the available space.

**Syntax**: `repeat(auto-fit, size)`
- `auto-fit` can also be used with `minmax()` to define the size range for the grid tracks.
- The grid tracks will stretch to fill the available space, up to the `max-size` specified in `minmax()`.

<u>**Example 1: **</u>  The grid will create as many `200px` wide columns as can fit within the container's width.
```css
.grid-container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 200px);
}
```

<u>**Example 2:**</u> The grid container will create as many columns as possible, with a minimum width of `100px` and a maximum width of `300px`.
```css
.grid-container {
  /* fit as many columns as possible, each column has the min-width of 100px
    when the page expands, each column can grow up to a max of 300px */
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 300px));
}
```
#### 2. `auto-fill`
**`auto-fill`** is also a value used with the `repeat()` function. It **creates as many grid tracks (rows or columns) as possible to fill the entire grid container**, adding implicit grid tracks if needed, even if there are no grid items to fill them.

**Syntax**: `repeat(auto-fill, size)`
- `auto-fill` can also be used with `minmax()` to define the size range for the grid tracks.
- The grid tracks will stretch to fill the available space, up to the `max-size` specified in `minmax()`.

<u>**Example: **</u> The grid will create as many rows as needed to fill the container's height, with each row having an equal `1fr` height.
```css
.grid-container {
  grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fill, 1fr);
}
```

> **Difference between `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`**
> - `auto-fit` creates only as many grid tracks as needed to fit the grid items.
> -  `auto-fill` creates as many grid tracks as needed to fill the entire grid container, even if there are no grid items to fill the remaining tracks.
> 
> As seen in the demonstration image below, `auto-fit` doesn’t create any more tracks after Item 3, but `auto-fill` creates 3 more tracks to fill the entire grid, even though there are no more items to fill the remaining tracks.

## IV. Flexbox and Grid
