Browsers apply a set of **default styles** to every webpage. These styles are part of the *user-agent stylesheets*, ensuring **basic styling for webpages without CSS**. Each browser has its own set of user-agent stylesheets so the default styles can vary slightly between browsers.
* The rules you write in your stylesheet have higher precedence than the user-agent rules and therefore overwrite the defaults. 
* Some developers use CSS resets - stylesheets containing CSS rules aimed at altering/removing the defaults set by user-agent stylesheets â†’ a clean slate to apply styles without interference.
