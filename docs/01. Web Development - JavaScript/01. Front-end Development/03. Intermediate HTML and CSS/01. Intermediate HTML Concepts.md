SVGs are a _scalable_ image format → they will easily scale to any size and retain quality without increasing their filesize. They’re useful if you need to create/modify images programmatically because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript. They’re often used for: 
* icons
* graphs/charts
* large, simple images
* patterned backgrounds
* applying effects to other elements via SVG filters. 

**Vector** graphics are images defined by math coordinates rather than a grid of pixels - raster graphics.
* Raster graphics: the detail is limited to the size of that pixel grid. The more you zoom into the raster graphics, the more blurry it is going to get. 
* Vector graphics: remain sharp and clear at any size because they are based on mathematical formulas for shapes and lines. This scalability without loss of quality is a key advantage of vector graphics.
