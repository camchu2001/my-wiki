SVGs are a _scalable_ image format → they will easily scale to any size and retain quality without increasing their filesize. They’re useful if you need to create/modify images programmatically because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript. They’re often used for: 
* icons
* graphs/charts
* large, simple images
* patterned backgrounds
* applying effects to other elements via SVG filters. 

**Vector** graphics are images defined by math coordinates rather than a grid of pixels - raster graphics.
* Raster graphics: the detail is limited to the size of that pixel grid. The more you zoom into the raster graphics, the more blurry it is going to get. 
* Vector graphics: remain sharp and clear at any size because they are based on mathematical formulas for shapes and lines. This scalability without loss of quality is a key advantage of vector graphics.

SVGs are defined using **XML** (Extensible Markup Language) - an HTML-like syntax used for many things, e.g., [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), [spreadsheet and word editor software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML). → SVGs are human-readable. 
```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <rect x=0 y=0 width=100 height=50 />
  <circle class="svg-circle" cx="50" cy="50" r="10"/>
</svg>
```

XML is designed to work seamlessly with HTML → you can put the XML code directly in an HTML file without changes, and it should display the image. Because these can become elements with the DOM just like HTML elements, we can target them with CSS and create them using the [Element WebAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element).
