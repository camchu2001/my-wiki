### 1. SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics
SVGs are a _scalable_ image format → they will easily scale to any size and retain quality without increasing their filesize. They’re useful if you need to create/modify images programmatically because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript. They’re often used for: 
* icons
* graphs/charts
* large, simple images
* patterned backgrounds
* applying effects to other elements via SVG filters. 

**Vector** graphics are images defined by math coordinates instead of a grid of pixels - raster graphics.
* Raster graphics: the detail is limited to the size of that pixel grid.
