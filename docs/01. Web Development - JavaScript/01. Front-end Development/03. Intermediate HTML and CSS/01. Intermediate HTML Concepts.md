## 1. SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics

SVGs are a _scalable_ image format → they will easily scale to any size and retain quality without increasing their filesize. They’re useful if you need to create/modify images programmatically because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript. They’re often used for: 
* icons
* graphs/charts
* large, simple images
* patterned backgrounds
* applying effects to other elements via SVG filters. 

**Vector** graphics are images defined by math coordinates rather than a grid of pixels - raster graphics.
* Raster graphics: the detail is limited to the size of that pixel grid. The more you zoom into the raster graphics, the more blurry it is going to get. 
* Vector graphics: remain sharp and clear at any size because they are based on mathematical formulas for shapes and lines. This scalability without loss of quality is a key advantage of vector graphics.

SVGs are defined using **XML** (Extensible Markup Language) - an HTML-like syntax used for many things, e.g., [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), [spreadsheet and word editor software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML). → SVGs are human-readable. 
```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <rect x=0 y=0 width=100 height=50 />
  <circle class="svg-circle" cx="50" cy="50" r="10"/>
</svg>
```

XML is designed to work seamlessly with HTML → you can put the XML code directly in an HTML file without changes, and it should display the image. Because these can become elements with the DOM just like HTML elements, we can target them with CSS and create them using the [Element WebAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element).

> SVGs are _great_ for relatively simple images, but because every single detail of the image needs to be written out as XML, they are extremely inefficient at storing complex images. If your image is supposed to be photo-realistic then SVGs are the wrong tool for the job.

### Embed SVGs
There are many ways to embed SVGs into HTML documents, but the two main approaches are: 
#### 1. Using `<img>` tag
```html
<img src="example.svg" alt="Example SVG">
```
This approach is much cleaner and simpler. They will still scale properly, but the contents of the SVG will not be accessible from the webpage. 
#### 2. Using inline SVG
```html
<svg width="200" height="200"> 
  <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" fill="blue"/> 
</svg>
```
It will still render correctly, but the SVG’s properties will be visible to your code, which will allow you to alter the image dynamically via CSS or JavaScript. 
* Even though it unlocks the SVGs full potential, it comes with some serious drawbacks: unreadability, and delay the rest of HTML elements from loading. 
## 2. Tables
HTML Tables allow you to create two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns. You create a table with `<table></table>` tags and then put the elements for rows `<tr>`, columns, headers `th`, or anything else that’s possible inside those table elements.
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>First Header</th> // 
    <th>Second Header</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This is a data cell</td>
    <td>This is also a data cell!</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
