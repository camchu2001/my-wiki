Summary: The book studies the formation of habits, showing how by starting with _**small changes**_, we can achieve _**remarkable results**_ in our every day life.
## The Fundamentals
1. **The Surprising Power of _Atomic_ Habits**
- Habits cannot be created in one day, it is the result of a **long-term** effort. There are good habits but there are also bad ones.
- Small changes appears to make no difference until they hit a certain threshold. So you have to be **patient**.
- If you failed to create good habits, it is not because you are not strong enough, it is because your _system_ has a problem.
    - We should _forget about setting goals_. eg: I will read 30m today.
    - But instead _focus on building a system_. eg: I will delete Youtube off of my phone, then sit down and become a reader.

2. **How Your Habits Shape Your _Identity_ (and Vice Versa)**
- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
    - By **focusing on who you wish to become** (identity change), you can effectively change your habits.
    - This is because your identify emerges out of your habits, your actions represent the type of person you wish to become.

    → By expanding your identify - _I am a hardworking person. I am not a quitter._ - you become **a better version of yourself**. Then your good habits will follow.
    

3. **How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps**
- A habit is a behavior repeated enough times to become automatic. You don’t have to think about what you do, so life is automatic and easier.
- A habit can be broken down to a feedback loop with 4 steps:
    - **Cue**: a sign/thing that triggers your brain to act. eg: You sit down at your desk with your computer and feel tired and stressed.
    - **Craving**: you want to do something to relieve this trigger. eg: You want to relieve this exhaustion.
    - **Response**: you do it. eg: You press on Youtube.
    - **Reward**: you feel better afterwards. eg: You are entertained and feel relaxed.

→ Watching Youtube first thing when you sit down at the desk becomes a habit.

- To break a habit:    
    - Cue: Make it invisible.
    - Craving: Make it unattractive.
    - Response: Make it difficult to do.
    - Reward: Make it unsatisfying.
- To create a habit:  
    - Cue: Make it obvious.
    - Craving: Make it attractive.
    - Response: Make it easy.
    - Reward: Make it satisfying.
### The First Law - Make it Obvious
- When something becomes a habit, we stop thinking about it. We can unconsciously continue doing bad habits without realizing it.
- We can use **Point and Calling**, which calls out what you are doing, raises your awareness, so you can consciously notice that it is bad.
    - eg: I am watching Youtube, this is not productive. I should stop.
- The **Habits Scorecard**, which lists out everything you do every day down to every minute/action and scores them _+ (good), - (bad), or = (neutral)_, can help identify the bad pattern in your life.

e.g: Habits Score Card - What do I do at Work:

|Sit down and open Youtube first|-|
|---|---|
|Spend 1 hour watching Youtube|-|
|Work for real|+|
|Struggling with work so I switch to music|=|
|Work a bit for real|+|
|Eat lunch|+|
|Feel sleepy|=|
|Go to take a nap|-|

1. **The Best Way to Start a New Habit**
- The most two common cues are **time** and **location**.
- Creating an implementation _string of action_ can pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
    - eg: I will [DO WORK] at [9:00 a.m.] at [MY DESK IN THE OFFICE].
- Habit stacking can **pair a new habit with a current habit.**
    - eg: After I [DRINK MY FIRST SIP OF COFFEE], I will [OPEN MY CODE].

2. **Design Your Environment for Motivation**
- Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice the cues that stands out.
    - So, **make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.**
    - Eventually, your good habits will be associated with the context of the environment. → You want to work as soon as you sit in the desk.
- This makes it easier to fight against tempting cues.

3. **The Secret to Self Control**
- When a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
- High self-control means spending less time in tempting situation. It’s _**easier to avoid temptation than resist it.**_
    - We should reduce exposure to tempting cues.
- Self-control is not long term. It’s only short term.
### The Second Law - Make it Attractive
- What makes an action so attractive is not the fulfillment of it but the anticipation for it. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine strike.
- We can bundle temptation. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do, with one that you need to do.
- Associate the habit you want to form with your other habits with a positive vibe to make it more attractive.

1. **The Role of Family and Friends**
- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved by our culture.    
- We tend to imitate the habits of our family and friends, the many, and the powerful.
    
    - To create good habits, **join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.**
    - And you have something in common with the group.
    
→ Our behavior can be approved, respected, and praised → It becomes more attractive.
