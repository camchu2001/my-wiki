The bookstore is odd, it normally sells old books, but also contains a separate collection of books for members of the store to come and borrow from, Clay calls the Waybacklist. Members of the store are often elderly people who come to the store at strange hours. With their membership card they always come to exchange a book for a new one. Clay is ordered by Mr. Penumbra to record every transaction with every tiny details and never to look inside any of the Waybacklist books. However, Clay was curious about the books and decided to sneak a peak, the membership only books are all written in code. When Clay asks Mr Penumbra about the membership and the coded books, he learned that the books present a puzzle that can be solve with time and care, some people devote their lives to solving this puzzle. To become a member, one must vow to read the books deeply in a way that honors the author.
