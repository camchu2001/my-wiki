Iâ€™ve watched numerous videos on YouTube, read articles on Medium, and perused personal blogs about people's experiences with books. All of them echo the same sentiment: "_When I was a kid, I used to read a lot. But when I became an adult, I stopped reading._" [Answer in Progress](https://www.youtube.com/@answerinprogress) even made a [video](https://youtu.be/LyUVgcsjp8s?si=B3Ijs3ewG2ZDAWVL) investigating and analyzing the "phenomenon" of why bookworms stopped reading.

Long story short, the same thing that happened to those bookworms happened to me. As I grew older, my reading dwindled. I once loved reading, but now the idea of picking up a book and start reading suddenly seems extremely difficult. This needs to change. 

And so, after finding inspiration from [Huyen Chip](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22327517.Chip_Huyen), I've decided to transform my relationship with books and reading. I want to embark on a journey to try and finish 1000 books by the end of my lifetime. It's a monumental challenge to undertake after not reading for so long, it will take a lifetime of commitment, and I may not succeed. But I know this journey will change how I read, how I approach reading, and hopefully, it will change me as a person for the better. I am committed to teaching myself a lot along the way. So, I want to give it a try.

Not all of these books are going to be great or extraordinary, but they will be books that I've read and experienced. I will document my reading journey [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/163623115-camchu) and promise to adhere to a disciplined reading routine.
