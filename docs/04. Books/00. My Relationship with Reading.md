I’ve seen numerous videos on Youtube, articles on Medium and personal blogs about people’s experience with books. All of them say the exact same thing, “*When I was a kid, I used to read a lot. But when I became an adult, I stopped reading”.* [Answer in Progress](https://www.youtube.com/@answerinprogress) even made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyUVgcsjp8s&t=1174s) investing and analyzing the “phenomenon” of why bookworms stopped reading. 

Long story short, the same thing that happened to those bookworms happened to me. The older I got, the less I read. I loved reading, but now the idea of picking up a book and start reading suddenly seems extremely difficult. After being inspired by [Huyen Chip](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22327517.Chip_Huyen), I’ve decided that I need to transform my relationship with books and reading. I want to go on a journey to try and finish 1000 books by the end of this lifetime. This journey will change the way I read, the way I approach reading, change who I am as a person (hopefully for the better), and I will no doubt teach me a lot. 

Not all of these books are going to be great, extraordinary books, but they will become books that I’ve read and experienced. I will record my reading journey [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/163623115-camchu) and am promising to commit myself to a disciplined routine of reading.
