## Summary
### 1. The Book Store
Clay Jannon, a web designer graduated from Art school who recently lost his job due to the economics downfall, found himself working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore. The bookstore is odd, it normally sells old books, but also contains a separate collection of books for members of the store to come and borrow from, Clay calls the Waybacklist. Members of the store are often elderly people who come to the store at strange hours. With their membership card they always come to exchange a book for a new one. Clay is ordered by Mr. Penumbra to record every transaction with every tiny details and never to look inside any of the Waybacklist books. However, Clay was curious about the books and decided to sneak a peak, the membership only books are all written in code. When Clay asks Mr Penumbra about the membership and the coded books, he learned that the books present a puzzle that can be solve with time and care, some people devote their lives to solving this puzzle. To become a member, one must vow to read the books deeply in a way that honors the author.

Slowly the mystery of the bookstore reveals itself. One night, a man named Eric rushes into the store to deliver a package to Mr. Penumbra - a new addition to the Waybacklist collection. Clay then learns this bookstore is part of a network of bookstores worldwide, and they’re overseen by *Corvina*. 

In his spare time at the store, Clay decided to brush up on his skills and make 3D graphics of the bookstore. Clay continues with his 3D data visualization of the store. A girl named Kat walks into the store, she's a Googler who works in data visualization and is interested in Clay's 3D model. She suggested adding a time series to it, and so Clay did, and using the improved 3D model, he seems to have detected a pattern in the checked-out books. All the customers seem to be following the same pattern, borrowing specific books one at a time. Clay and Kat decide to gather more data from previous log books to confirm this theory.

His roommate, Mat, who specializes in in creating special effects at a studio, decides to help Clay make a replica of an older log book so that Clay and bring the actual log book to Google for scanning.
