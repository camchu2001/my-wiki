### 1. `while` loop
```js
while(condition){
  // code
  // loop body
}
```
While the `condition` is truthy, the `code` from the loop body is executed.
```js
// while i < 3, the loop will continue to output the value of i
let i = 0; 
while(i < 3){
  console.log(i); 
  i++; 
}

// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

If `i++` was missing from the example above, the loop would repeat (in theory) forever → infinite loop. 
### 2. `do...while` loop
```js
do {
  // loop body
} while (condition); 
```
The loop will first execute the body, then check the condition, and, while it’s truthy, execute it again and again.
```js
let i = 0; 
do {
  console.log(i); 
  i++
} while (i < 3); 

// 0, 1, 2
```

This form of syntax should only be used when you want **the body of the loop to execute** **at least once** regardless of the condition being truthy. Usually, the other form is preferred: `while(…) {…}`.
### 3. `for` loop
The `for` loop is more complex, but it’s also the most commonly used loop.
```js
for (begin; condition; step){
  // loop body
}

Run begin 
→ (if condition → run body and run step) 
→ (if condition → run body and run step) 
→ (if condition → run body and run step) 
→ ...
```

```js
for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  console.log(i); 
}

// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| begin     | `let i = 0`      | Executes once upon entering the loop.                          |
| condition | `i < 3`          | Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops. |
| body      | `console.log(i)` | Runs again and again while the condition is truthy.            |
| step      | `i++`            | Executes after the body on each iteration.                     |
That is, `begin` executes once, and then it iterates: after each `condition` test, `body` and `step` are executed.
### 4. `break` the Loop
Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy. But we can **force the exit** at any time using the special **`break`** directive.
```js
// the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no number is entered

let sum = 0; 
while(true){
  let value = prompt("Enter a number", ''); 
  
  if(!value) {
    break; // (*)
  }
  sum += value; 
}

console.log("Sum: " + sum); // (**)
```
→ The `break` directive is activated at the line `(*)` if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop, `(**)`.

The combination **“infinite loop + `break` as needed”** is great for situations when a loop’s condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.
