We have been using several types until now, such as data type `number` and `string`. We will discuss all eight data types in JavaScript in better detail in this section. 
### 0. The `typeof` operator
The `typeof` operator returns the type of the operand. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check. We can better see the use of `typeof` in the following sections. 
```js
typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof 10n // "bigint"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

typeof Math // "object" (1)

typeof null // "object" (2)

typeof alert // "function" (3)
```
### 1. Number
* The [**number**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) type represents both integer and floating point numbers. 
* There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication `*`, division `/`, addition `+`, subtraction `-`, and so on. 
* Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `NaN`.
```js
let n = 123; 
n = 12.345; 
console.log(typeof(n)); // Output: number
```
* The [`Number()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/Number) function converts anything passed to it into a number if it can. Try the following: 
```js
const myString = "123";
const myNum = Number(myString);
console.log(typeof myNum); // Ouput: number
```
### 2. BigInt
In JavaScript, the “***number***” type cannot safely represent integer values larger than $(2^{53}- 1)$`(that’s 9007199254740991`), or less than $-(2^{53}- 1)$ for negatives. If they do, there may be precision error. → We can use type `BigInt` to help store these large values, though they are rarely needed. 
* We can declare a BigInt by appending `n` to the end of an integer.
```js 
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
console.log(typeof(bigInt)); // Output: bigint
```
### 3.Strings
> **Resources**
> - [Handling text - strings in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings)

> <u>**Note**</u>: There are not character `char` type in JavaScript. 

 1. A **string** is a **piece of text** and and is declared with surrounding *quotes*. There are three types of quotes we can use to surround a string in JavaScript: 
* Double quote: `"Hello"`
* Single quote: `'Hello'`
* Backticks: ``Hello` `

***Double and single quotes*** are “simple” quotes. There’s practically *no difference* between them in JavaScript. 
```js
let userName = "My Name"; 
console.log(typeof(userName)); // Output: string
```

2. **String Literals:** we use ***backticks*** and **`${...}`** to embed variables and expressions into a string. 
* The expression inside `${…}` is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string. We can put anything in there: a variable like `name` or an arithmetical expression like `1 + 2` or something more complex.
```js
let userName = "My Name";
console.log(`Hello, my name is: ${userName}!`)
// Output: Hello,  my name is My Name!
```
* Using template literals, we can include expressions in strings: 
```js
const song = "Hello World";
const score = 9;
const highestScore = 10;
const output = `I like the song ${song}. I gave it a score of ${
  (score / highestScore) * 100
}%.`;
console.log(output); // Output: "I like the song Hello World. I gave it a score of 90%."
```

3. JavaScript strings are ***immutable***. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it. 
```js
let myString = "Hello!"
myString[0] = "Y"; // We're trying to turn this string into "Yello"; 
// but this will cause an error
```

4. **String Concatenation**:
We can concatenate normal strings using the **`+`** operator: 
```js
const greeting = "Hello";
const name = "User1";
console.log(greeting + ", " + name); // "Hello, User1"
```
→ However, template literals usually give you more *readable* code.
### 4. Boolean 
The **boolean** type has only two values: `true` and `false`. This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: `true` means “yes, correct”, and `false` means “no, incorrect”.
```js
let greaterThanOne = true; 
let greaterThanTen = false; 
console.log(typeof(greaterThanOne)) // Output: 
```

Boolean values also come as a **result of comparisons:**
```js
let isGreater = 4 > 1; 
console.log(isGreater); // Output: true;
```
### 5. “null” Value
The special **`null`** value does not belong to any of the types described above. It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the `null` value. It’s just a special value which represents *“nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.*
```js
let age = null; // age is unknown
console.log(typeof(age)); // Output: object - because null is an object in JavaScript
```
### 6. “undefined” Value
The special value **`undefined`** also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like `null`. The meaning of `undefined` is “value is not assigned”.
* If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is `undefined`. 
```js
let x; 
console.log(typeof(x)); // Output: undefined
```
### 7. Symbols
A [`symbol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) is a **unique** and **immutable** primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.
### 8. Objects
The **`object`** type is special. All other types are called “***primitive***” because their values can contain only a *single thing* (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store **collections of data** and more **complex entities.** 

**Arrays** in JavaScript, though best described as arrays, is also considered a type of objects. 

```js
let user = { // an object called user
	name: "John", // the key "name" store value "John"
	age: 30 // the key "age" store value 30
};

console.log(typeof (user)); // Output: object

const students = ["Annie", "Ben", "Cam"]; 
console.log(typeof(students)); // Output: object
```
