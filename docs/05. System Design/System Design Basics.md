1. <u>**Large scale distributed systems:**</u>
* **Large scale**: handle massive amounts of data and require significant computing power.
* **Distributed systems**: workload is **spread across multiple servers** in different locations, not on a single central server.
	* if a server fails, other servers can take the load and keep the system running → **fault tolerant.**
	* when searching the web - results can be fetched from geographically closer servers, making it faster. → **performance**.
	* additional servers can be easily added to handle the extra load, making the system adaptable to growth. → **scalability**.
2. <u>** Software Design Pattern:**</u> 
* **building blocks** that provide **general, reusable solutions** to **commonly occurring problems** within a given context in software design.
* <u>Example</u>: Publisher Subscriber Model.
→ System design patterns allow for scalable, maintainable systems because engineers can take a lot of business requirements and convert them into technical solutions.
