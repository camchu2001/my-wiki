<u>1. **Large scale distributed systems</u>**
* **Large scale**: handle massive amounts of data and require significant computing power.
* **Distributed systems**: workload is spread across multiple servers in different locations, not on a single central server.
	* if a server fails, other servers can take the load and keep the system running → fault tolerant.
	* when searching the web - results can be fetched from geographically closer servers, making it faster. → performance
	* additional servers can be easily added to handle the extra load, making the system adaptable to growth. → scalability.
