### 1. A developer's perspective

* Developers write code that is **deployed** to a **server**. For now, let's define a **server** as a computer that handles requests from another computer. 
* This server also requires **persistent storage** to store the application's data. As such, a server may talk to an external storage system (database, cloud etc). This storage may not be part of the same server, and is instead connected through a **network**.
### 2. A user’s perspective

A user is someone who **makes a request to the server,** usually through a web browser. 
* If a user wanted to use a front-end feature, the server will respond with the JavaScript/HTML/CSS code, compiled to display what the user requested. 
* A user can also make a request to a back-end server API, the server will respond with data, possibly in the JSON format, or other formats. 

But, what if we have **a lot of users** and the **single server cannot handle** all of the requests on its own?
* We can determine the bottleneck, maybe the CPU is not fast enough, maybe we don’t have enough RAM. 
→ we can upgrade the hardware of our single server to help it perform better. → **vertical scaling** (to take a single resource and make it better.)
* Because we cannot scale a single server infinitely, we can use **horizontal scaling**, which is to have more servers running our code.
→ users don’t have to talk to a single server but multiple. → we can handle more requests at the same time.
