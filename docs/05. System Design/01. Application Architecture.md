### 1. A developer's perspective

* Developers write code that is **deployed** to a **server**. For now, let's define a **server** as a computer that handles requests from another computer. 
* This server also requires **persistent storage** to store the application's data. As such, a server may talk to an external storage system (database, cloud etc). This storage may not be part of the same server, and is instead connected through a **network**.
### 2. A user’s perspective

A user is someone who **makes a request to the server,** usually through a web browser. 
* If a user wanted to use a front-end feature, the server will respond with the JavaScript/HTML/CSS code, compiled to display what the user requested. 
* A user can also make a request to a back-end server API, the server will respond with data, possibly in the JSON format, or other formats. 

But, what if we have **a lot of users** and the **single server cannot handle** all of the requests on its own?
