* Developers write code that is **deployed** to a **server**. For now, let's define a **server** as a computer that handles requests from another computer. 
* This server also requires **persistent storage** to store the application's data. As such, a server may talk to an external storage system (database, cloud etc). This storage may not be part of the same server, and is instead connected through a **network**.
