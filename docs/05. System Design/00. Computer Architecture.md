## 1. Components
### 1. Disk
* A disk is the primary **storage device** for data in a computer. It is **persistent**, meaning the data will be persisted even when the computer crashes or is turned off.
* How much information the disk can store is usually measured in **TBs** (terabytes). (10^12 bytes)
#### 1. HDD - Hard Disk Drives
* Mechanical, and have a head/write head. 
* The older they get, the more wear and tear they collect which slows them down overtime. 
#### 2. SDD - Solid-state Drive
* Significantly faster and more popular. 
* They do not have moving parts, and rely on reading and writing data electronically (similar to RAM). 
### 2. RAM - Random Access Memory
* Used for storing information but is typically a lot smaller in size compared to disk drives.
