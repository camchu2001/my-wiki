# Welcome! 
Hello there~ My name is **Cam**, welcome to my wiki page! This wiki site acts like a giant notebook for everything I am learning and am interested in, all written down using **Obsidian**. 

This page is not a finished product but more like a living document that grows with me. Feel free to explore my notes and see if anything catches your eye. Iâ€™m still learning, so my notes arenâ€™t perfect yet. If you find anything youâ€™d like to give me **feedback** on, contact me through my [website](https://camchu.me/) â€“ I'd love to connect! 

Hopefully youâ€™ll find something interesting here. Thanks for stopping by!

# Build your own Wiki Page
This simple wiki page was built using Docusaurus, itâ€™s a cute and wonderful site generator that you can use to quickly build and publish your personal notes. I find their [Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs) really helpful, if you want, you can take a look at my [Github](https://github.com/camchu2001/my-wiki) for a better idea.

# Publish your Obsidian notes
My workflow is really simple. I love taking notes using markdown, and **Obsidian** has been a great tool to help me organize and systemize my notes. What I do to publish my Obsidian notes (*you can easily do too*) is backing up my Obsidian notes to my Github repo using Obsidianâ€™s [Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git), then deploying my wiki site using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

There are other ways to publish and [deploy](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) your notes, there are also better ways and more optimized workflows to do it, too, I just did what is the easiest and fastest way for me. Iâ€™ll continue to improve this workflow in the future, hopefully soon. ðŸ˜Š Thank you~
