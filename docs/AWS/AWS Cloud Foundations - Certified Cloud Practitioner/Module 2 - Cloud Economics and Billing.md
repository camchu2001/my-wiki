## 1. Fundamentals of pricing
### 1. AWS Pricing Model
There are 3 **fundamental drivers** of cost with AWS. 
1. **Compute**: charged **per hour**/second (for Linux) and **varies by instance type**. 
2. **Storage**: charged typically **per GB**. 
3. **Data transfer**: charged typically **per GB**. 
	* In most cases, there is **no charge for inbound data transfer**, data that you put into AWS is free. Data transfer between services in the same region is also free.
	* For outbound data transfers, it is **aggregated across services** and **charged at the outbound data transfer rate**. 
### 2. Pay for AWS
1. <u>**Pay for what you use**</u>: 
	* At the end of each month, you only pay for the service that you consume for as long as you use it, with no large upfront-expenses. 
	* All services are available on demand, so you can **start/stop using a service at any time**, as there are no long term contracts required. 
2. <u>**Pay less by using more**</u>:
	* You can get volume based **discounts as your usage increases**. 
	* **Tiered pricing** for services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) → ***the more you use, the less you pay per GB.*** 
	* Multiple storage services offer options to help **lower pricing** based on your needs and how frequently you access your data. 
3. <u>**Pay even less as AWS grows**</u>:
	* AWS passing savings from economies of scale to you. 
	* Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing 75 times (as of September 2019). 
	* Future higher-performing resources replace current resources for no extra charge. 
4. <u>**Custom pricing**</u>: is available if the current pricing models don’t work for your project. 
5. <u>**AWS Free Tier**</u>: enables you to gain **free hands-on experience** with the AWS platform, products, and services. It’s free for 1 year for new customers. 
	* **Services with no charge**: Amazon VPC, Elastic Beanstalk, Auto Scaling, AWS CloudFormation, AWS Identity and Access Management. 
	* There might be charges associated with other AWS services that are used with these services.
