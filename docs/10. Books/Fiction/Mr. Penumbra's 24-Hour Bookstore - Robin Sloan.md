### 1. The Book Store
Clay Jannon, a web designer graduated from Art school who recently lost his job due to the economics downfall, found himself working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore. The bookstore is odd, it normally sells old books, but also contains a separate collection of books for members of the store to come and borrow from, Clay calls the Waybacklist. Members of the store are often elderly people who come to the store at strange hours. With their membership card they always come to exchange a book for a new one. Clay is ordered by Mr. Penumbra to record every transaction with every tiny details and never to look inside any of the Waybacklist books. However, Clay was curious about the books and decided to sneak a peak, the membership only books are all written in code. When Clay asks Mr Penumbra about the membership and the coded books, he learned that the books present a puzzle that can be solve with time and care, some people devote their lives to solving this puzzle. To become a member, one must vow to read the books deeply in a way that honors the author.

Slowly the mystery of the bookstore reveals itself. One night, a man by the name of Eric rushes into the store to deliver a package to Mr. Penumbra - a new addition to the Waybacklist collection. Clay then learns this bookstore is part of a network of bookstores around the world, and they’re overseen by *Corvina*.
