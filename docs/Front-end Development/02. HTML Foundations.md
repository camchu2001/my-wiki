### General Definition
![](https://i.imgur.com/zEGd7Hs.png)

1. **HTML** and **CSS** are two languages that work together to create everything you see when you look at webpages on the Internet. **HTML** and **CSS** are used to display and present information, they are not used to program any logic, unlike [**JavaScript**](https://www.brytdesigns.com/html-css-javascript-whats-the-difference). 
* **HTML**: *Hypertext Markup Language*, is the raw data that the webpages are built out of. These data/information consists of *texts, links, cards, lists, buttons*, etc. → HTML puts information on a webpage. 
* **CSS**: *Cascading Style Sheets*, is what adds style to those plain elements (colors, font styles, layout, responsive features). → CSS makes the display of information on the webpage looks great. 
2. **JavaScript** is a programming language which allows elements on your website more interactive and engaging for users. 
# 2. Elements and Tags

1. Almost all ***elements*** in HTML consists of three parts: 
* an ***opening*** (`<>`) tag
* a ***closing*** (`</>`) tag
* the content that goes between these two tags. 

***Example***: A ***paragraph element*** looks like this in HTML: `<p> The texts in my paragraph </p>`
* `<p>`: the opening tag.
* `The texts in my paragraph`: represents the data/content wrapped in by opening and closing tags. 
* `</p>`: the closing tag. 

2. Some HTML elements do not have closing tags, such as `<br>` or `<img>`. They’re known as ***void elements*** because there’s nothing inside them, they don’t wrap content in them like other tags do. 
These elements can also have self-closing tags: `<br/> or <img/>` but the use of self-closing tags is ***widely discouraged*** as they might make the element interact badly with other HTML features. 
# 3. HTML Boilerplate
> [!resources]
> [HTML Boilerplate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate)

All HTML documents have the same basic structure (boilerplate) that needs to be set in place in order for the HTML code to work. 

**Example**: An HTML Boilerplate generated in VSCode using `! + enter` shortcut: 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Document</title>
</head>

<body></body>

</html>
```

1. **DOCTYPE**: Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration, which tells the browser what ***version of HTML*** it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5 → `DOCTYPE html`
2. **`html`** element: the ***root element*** of the document, every other element in the document will be descendent of it. The `html` element also has an opening and closing tag. 
	* `lang` attribute: specifies the language of the text content, in this case it’s English. 
3. **`head`** element: where we put ***meta-information*** about our webpages in order to ***render the webpage correctly***. This is **not** where we put elements to display content/information on the page. 
	* `meta` element: has the charset encoding of the webpage, which ensures the webpage will display symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser. 
4. **`title`** element: gives the ***webpage the title*** that’s displayed in the webpage’s browser tab. By default, the page has the “Document” title.
5. **`body`** element: this element contains all the ***content that will be displayed*** on the webpage. 
# 4. HTML Text
### 1. Paragraphs
A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content with a `<p>` tag. 
```html
<body>

	<p> Hello, this is my first paragraph in HTML </p>
	<p> This is another paragraph </p>

</body>
```
### 2. Headings
Headings display larger and bolder texts in comparison to paragraphs. There are 6 different levels of headings starting from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with the largest and most important heading being `<h1>` and the tiniest heading at the lowest level being `<h6>`

```html
<h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
...
<h6>This is a heading 6</h6>
```
### 3. Strong element
The `<strong>` element makes the text bold and semantically **marks the text as important.** 
→ This means that tools (search tools, screen readers), will signify the text as more important. 
We can use the `<strong>` element along with other text elements. 
```html
<p> I am <strong>bold</strong> and <strong>important</strong>! </p>
```
### 4. Em element
The `<em` element makes text italic and semantically places emphasis on the text, which may again affect relevant tools. 
We can use the `<em>` element along with other text elements. 
```html
<p> I am <em>italicized</em> and <em>emphasized</em>! </p>
```
# 5. HTML Lists
### 1. Unordered Lists
***Unordered lists*** are created during the `<ul>` element, each item within the list is creating using the list item element `<li>`, each item is bullet-pointed by default. 
```html
<ul>
	<li>Item 1</li>
	<li>Item 2</li>
	<li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
### 2. Ordered Lists
***Ordered lists*** are created using the `<ol>` element, each item within the list is created using `<li>`, each item is numbered by default. 
```html
<ol>
	<li>Item 1</li>
	<li>Item 2</li>
	<li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

# 6. HTML Links and Images

### 0. Attributes in HTML
An HTML ***attribute*** gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the ***element’s opening tag.*** 
### 1. Anchor elements
To create a link in HTML, we use the **anchor element**, `<a>`. Anchor elements can be used to link to anything, videos, pdf files, even other HTML documents. 
* The anchor element usually comes with an additional attribute **`href`** which contains the destination our link wants to go. 
```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Click Me to Google!</a>
```

→ Any text wrapped with an anchor tag without the `href` attribute will look like plain text. The `href` attribute allows the browser to give the text a blue color and underline → signifying a link. 
* The **`target`** attribute specifies where the linked resource will be opened. By default, it will take the `_self` value, which opens the link in the current tab. We can set the `target`’s value to `_blank` to open the link in a new tab/window. 
```html
<a href="https://www.google.com" 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer">
Click me and open me in a new Tab.
</a>
```
→ It’s ***recommended*** to pair a `target="_blank"` with a `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. 
* **`noopener`** value prevents the open link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. 
* **`noreferrer`** value presents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has the link to it. 
### 2. Absolute and Relative links
Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create: 
1. Links to pages on other websites on the Internet → **absolute links.** 
	* A typical absolute link will look like this: `protocol://domain/path`
2. Links to pages located on our own websites. → **relative links.** 
	* A relative links will not include the domain name as it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on. 

***Example***: 
```html
<body>
  <h1>Homepage</h1>
  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">An Absolute Link</a>

  <a href="pages/about.html">A Relative Link to the our About Page</a>
</body>
```
### 3. Images
To display an image in HTML, we use the `<img>` element, which is an element that does not need a closing tag. 
The element doesn’t wrap content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using the ***`src`*** attribute, which tells the web browser where to locate the image. 
→ The element can embed an image using ***both absolute/relative path*** through this `src` attribute. 
```html
 <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
 <img src="/images/my-image.jpg>
```
* **`alt`** attribute: gives an alternative text to describe the image. This description will be used in place of the image it that image cannot be loaded. 
```html
<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png"
	 alt="the odin project logo">
```
* **`height`** and **`width`** attributes determine the size of the image. It is recommended to always specify these attributes. 
```html
 <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" width="310">
```
