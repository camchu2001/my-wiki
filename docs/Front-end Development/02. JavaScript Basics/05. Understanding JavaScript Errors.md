An error is a type of object built into the JavaScript language, consisting of a **name/type** and a **message**. 

<u>**Example 1:**</u>
```js
const a = "Hello"; 
const b = "World"; 

console.log(c); 
```

The **`ReferenceError`** is thrown because here, it *refers to a variable that is not declared and/or initialized within the current scope*. 

<u>**Example 2:**</u>
```js
> 1  const a = 5; 
> 2  const b = 10; 
> 3
> 4	 function add(){
> 5	   return c; 
> 6	 }
> 7	
> 8	 function print(){
> 9	   add();
> 10  }
> 11	
> 12  print(); 
```

The **stack trace** tells us that: 
1. `c is not defined` in the scope of `add()`, which is declared on line 5. 
2. `add()` was called by `print()`, which was declared on line 9. 
3. `print()` itself was called on line 12. 
→ this allows you to trace the evolution of an error back to its origin, which here is the declaration of `add()`; 
## Common Types of Errors
### 1. Syntax Error
> **Resource**
> [MDN - Syntax Errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError)

A **syntax error** occurs when the code you are trying to run is not written in accordance with the grammatical rules of JavaScript. 
```js
function helloWorld(){
  console.log "Hello World!"
}
```

→ this is because we forgot the parentheses for `console.log()`
