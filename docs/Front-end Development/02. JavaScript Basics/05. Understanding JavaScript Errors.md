An error is a type of object built into the JavaScript language, consisting of a **name/type** and a **message**. 

<u>**Example 1:**</u>
```js
const a = "Hello"; 
const b = "World"; 

console.log(c); 
```

The **`ReferenceError`** is thrown because here, it *refers to a variable that is not declared and/or initialized within the current scope*. 

<u>**Example 2:**</u>
```js
> 1  const a = 5; 
> 2  const b = 10; 
> 3
> 4	 function add(){
> 5	   return c; 
> 6	 }
> 7	
> 8	 function print(){
> 9	   add();
> 10  }
> 11	
> 12  print(); 
```

The **stack trace** tells us that: 
1. `c is not defined` in the scope of `add()`, which is declared on line 5. 
2. `add()` was called by `print()`, which was declared on line 9. 
3. `print()` itself was called on line 12. 
→ this allows you to trace the evolution of an error back to its origin, which here is the declaration of `add()`; 
## Common Types of Errors
### 1. Syntax Error
> **Resource**
> [MDN - SyntaxErrors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError)

A **syntax error** occurs when the code you are trying to run is not written in accordance with the grammatical rules of JavaScript. 
```js
function helloWorld(){
  console.log "Hello World!"
}
```

→ this is because we forgot the parentheses for `console.log()`
### 2. Reference Error
> **Resource**
> [MDN - ReferenceError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError)

We’ve seen `ReferenceError` in the examples in the prior section. This means whatever variable you are trying to reference does not exist within the current scope - or it has been spelled incorrectly. 
### 3. Type Error
> **Resource**
> [MDN - TypeError]([MDN - TypeError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError)

A `TypeError` may be thrown when
* an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function
* when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed
* when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way

<u>**Example: **</u>
```js
const str1 = "Hello"; 
const str2 = "World!"; 
const message = str1.push(str2); 
```

→ even though `push()` is a function, it isn’t a a function used on a String (it isn’t a String method), it’s used on arrays. 

> **Warning vs. Errors**
> *Warnings* are typically shown in yellow, while *errors* are typically shown in red. Errors will stop the execution of your program, but warnings are messages that provide you with insight on potential problems. 
> While you should address these warnings, they are not as significant as errors and are more likely to be informational.
