An error is a type of object built into the JavaScript language, consisting of a **name/type** and a **message**. 

<u>**Example 1:**</u>
```js
const a = "Hello"; 
const b = "World"; 

console.log(c); 
```

The **`ReferenceError`** is thrown because here, it *refers to a variable that is not declared and/or initialized within the current scope*. 

<u>**Example 2:**</u>
```js
const a = 5; 
const b = 10; 

function add(){
  return c; 
}

function print(){
  add();
}

print(); 
```

The **stack trace** tells us that: 
1. `c is not defined` in the scope of `add()`, which is declared on line 5. 
2.
